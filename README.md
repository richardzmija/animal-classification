# Animal-Classification

This project aims to use CNNs to create a classificator for four types
of animals: dogs, cats, horses and monkeys. We are also going to use
tools like Gradcam to assess interpretability of the model to ensure
that it uses meaningful features for classification. For more
information consult the [documentation for the project](
